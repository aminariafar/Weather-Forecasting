# Data Mining Project â€“ Air Quality Forecasting with RNN & LSTM

This project applies **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models** to the **Air Quality UCI dataset**. The goal is to perform time-series forecasting of air pollution levels by leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Air Quality UCI dataset (Date, Time, pollution indicators, weather variables).
- **Steps**:
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
  - Implementation of RNN and LSTM models for forecasting.
- **Tools & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn.
